## Database Schema

### Certificate Model (`server/models/Certificate.js`)

```javascript
{
  certificateId: String,        // Unique certificate ID
  studentId: ObjectId,          // Reference to User
  courseId: ObjectId,           // Reference to Course
  studentName: String,          // Student's full name
  courseTitle: String,          // Course title
  instructorName: String,       // Instructor name
  dateIssued: Date,            // Certificate issue date
  completionDate: Date,        // Course completion date
  pdfUrl: String,              // PDF file URL
  verificationHash: String,    // SHA-256 verification hash
  totalLessons: Number,        // Total course lessons
  completedLessons: Number,    // Completed lessons
  completionPercentage: Number // Course completion percentage
}
```

## API Endpoints

### Certificate Management

| Method | Endpoint | Description | Auth Required |
|--------|----------|-------------|---------------|
| POST | `/api/certificates/generate` | Generate certificate for course | Yes |
| GET | `/api/certificates/user` | Get user's certificates | Yes |
| GET | `/api/certificates/course/:courseId` | Get certificate for specific course | Yes |
| GET | `/api/certificates/download/:certificateId` | Download certificate PDF | Yes |
| GET | `/api/certificates/verify/:certificateId` | Verify certificate authenticity | No |

### Auto-Generation Integration

The system automatically triggers certificate generation in the progress controller:

```javascript
// In server/controllers/progressController.js
if (courseProgress.courseProgressPercentage >= 90) {
  try {
    const certificateController = require('./certificateController');
    await certificateController.autoGenerateCertificate(userId, courseId);
  } catch (certError) {
    console.error('Error auto-generating certificate:', certError);
  }
}
```

## Frontend Components

### 1. CertificatesPage (`frontend/src/pages/CertificatesPage.tsx`)
- Displays all user certificates
- Download functionality for each certificate
- Professional card-based layout
- Empty state for users without certificates

### 2. CertificateVerificationPage (`frontend/src/pages/CertificateVerificationPage.tsx`)
- Public verification interface
- Certificate ID input and validation
- Detailed certificate information display
- Verification status indicators

### 3. CertificateDownload (`frontend/src/components/CertificateDownload.tsx`)
- Reusable component for course cards
- Automatic certificate generation
- Download functionality
- Error handling and loading states

### 4. Dashboard Integration
- Certificate download buttons on completed courses
- Integration with existing progress tracking
- Seamless user experience

## PDF Generation

### Certificate Design
- **Format**: A4 landscape (842x595 points)
- **Font**: Helvetica (standard PDF font)
- **Layout**: Professional certificate design with:
  - Platform header and branding
  - Student name and course title
  - Completion date and certificate ID
  - Course statistics (lessons, completion rate)
  - Verification URL and instructions

### PDF Features
- Professional borders and styling
- Centered text layout
- Course completion statistics
- Verification information
- Platform branding

## Security Features

### 1. Verification Hash
```javascript
// Generate verification hash
const data = `${certificateId}-${studentId}-${courseId}-${dateIssued}`;
const hash = crypto.createHash('sha256').update(data).digest('hex');
```

### 2. Authentication
- All certificate operations require user authentication
- Users can only access their own certificates
- Download endpoints validate certificate ownership

### 3. Public Verification
- Verification endpoint is publicly accessible
- No authentication required for certificate verification
- Secure hash validation for authenticity

## Installation & Setup

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
cd server
npm install pdf-lib
```

### 2. Database Setup
The Certificate model will be automatically created when the server starts.

### 3. File Storage
Certificates are stored locally in `server/uploads/certificates/`. For production, consider using S3 or similar cloud storage.

### 4. Routes Integration
Certificate routes are automatically integrated into the main server:

```javascript
// In server/server.js
const certificateRoutes = require('./routes/certificateRoutes');
app.use('/api/certificates', certificateRoutes);
```

## Usage Examples

### Generate Certificate
```javascript
const response = await fetch('/api/certificates/generate', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}`
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({ courseId: 'course-id' })
});
```

### Download Certificate
```javascript
const response = await fetch(`/api/certificates/download/${certificateId}`, {
  headers: { 'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}` }
});
const data = await response.json();
// Use data.downloadUrl to download the PDF
```

### Verify Certificate
```javascript
const response = await fetch(`/api/certificates/verify/${certificateId}`);
const data = await response.json();
// Check data.verification.isValid for authenticity
```

## Testing

### Test Script
Use the provided test script to verify the certificate system:

```bash
cd server
node test-certificate-system.mjs
```

### Manual Testing
1. Complete a course to 90% or more
2. Check dashboard for certificate download button
3. Generate and download certificate
4. Verify certificate using the verification page

## Production Considerations

### 1. File Storage
- Use cloud storage (AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage) for PDF files
- Implement CDN for faster downloads
- Set up proper file permissions and access controls

### 2. Security
- Implement rate limiting for certificate generation
- Add certificate expiration dates if needed
- Consider blockchain verification for enhanced security

### 3. Performance
- Implement certificate caching
- Optimize PDF generation for large volumes
- Add background job processing for certificate generation

### 4. Monitoring
- Track certificate generation metrics
- Monitor verification requests
- Set up alerts for failed certificate generation

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **PDF Generation Fails**
   - Check if pdf-lib is properly installed
   - Verify file permissions for uploads directory
   - Check server logs for detailed error messages

2. **Certificate Not Generated**
   - Verify course progress is 90% or more
   - Check if certificate already exists for user-course combination
   - Ensure user has purchased the course

3. **Download Issues**
   - Verify file exists in uploads directory
   - Check authentication token
   - Ensure user owns the certificate

### Debug Logging
