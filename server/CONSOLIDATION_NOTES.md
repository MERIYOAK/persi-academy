# Server Consolidation Notes

## Overview
The server has been consolidated from two separate files (`server.js` and `serverEnhanced.js`) into a single `server.js` file with all enhanced features.

## Changes Made

### 1. Merged Server Files
- **Before**: Two separate server files
  - `server.js` - Basic server with simple routes
  - `serverEnhanced.js` - Enhanced server with advanced features
- **After**: Single `server.js` file with all features

### 2. Updated Package.json Scripts
- **Before**:
  ```json
  "start": "node serverEnhanced.js",
  "dev": "nodemon serverEnhanced.js"
  ```
- **After**:
  ```json
  "start": "node server.js",
  "dev": "nodemon server.js"
  ```

### 3. Enhanced Features Now Available in server.js
- ✅ Enhanced course routes with versioning system
- ✅ Archive management routes
- ✅ Admin dashboard statistics
- ✅ Better error handling and validation
- ✅ Graceful shutdown handling
- ✅ Environment variable validation
- ✅ Enhanced middleware configuration
- ✅ All legacy routes for backward compatibility

### 4. Route Structure
```
/api/auth          - Authentication routes
/api/admin         - Admin routes
/api/courses       - Enhanced course routes (PRIMARY)
/api/courses-legacy - Legacy course routes (backward compatibility)
/api/archive       - Archive management routes
/api/videos        - Video routes
/api/payment       - Payment routes
/api/user          - User routes
```

### 5. Environment Variables
The server now expects:
- `MONGODB_URI` (not `MONGO_URI`)
- `ADMIN_EMAIL` and `ADMIN_PASSWORD_HASH` for admin login
- `JWT_SECRET` for authentication
- AWS S3 configuration variables

### 6. Admin Features
- Admin dashboard statistics at `/api/admin/stats`
- Course versioning system
- Archive management
- Enhanced course management

## Usage
- **Development**: `npm run dev`
- **Production**: `npm start`

## Files Removed/Deprecated
- `serverEnhanced.js` - No longer needed (functionality merged into `server.js`)

## Benefits
1. **Single source of truth** - Only one server file to maintain
2. **All features available** - No need to choose between basic and enhanced
3. **Simplified deployment** - Clear entry point
4. **Better maintainability** - Consolidated codebase
5. **Backward compatibility** - Legacy routes still available

## Migration Notes
- All existing API endpoints remain the same
- Enhanced features are now the default
- Legacy routes available at `/api/courses-legacy` for backward compatibility
- Admin credentials must be configured in `.env` file
