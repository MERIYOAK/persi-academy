## Technical Implementation

### **Frontend Changes**

#### **Form Data Structure:**
```typescript
interface Video {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  description: string;
  file?: File;
  isFreePreview?: boolean; // NEW FIELD
}
```

#### **Form Submission:**
```typescript
const videoFormData = new FormData();
videoFormData.append('title', video.title);
videoFormData.append('description', video.description);
videoFormData.append('courseId', courseId);
videoFormData.append('order', order.toString());
videoFormData.append('isFreePreview', video.isFreePreview ? 'true' : 'false'); // NEW FIELD
videoFormData.append('file', video.file);
```

### **Backend Changes**

#### **Upload Controller:**
```javascript
// Extract and convert isFreePreview field
const isFreePreview = req.body.isFreePreview === 'true' || req.body.isFreePreview === true;

// Create video with free preview status
const video = await Video.create({ 
  title, 
  description,
  s3Key: uploadResult.s3Key,
  courseId,
  isFreePreview: isFreePreview, // NEW FIELD
  // ... other fields
});
```

#### **Response Structure:**
```javascript
res.status(201).json({
  success: true,
  message: `Video uploaded successfully${isFreePreview ? ' as free preview' : ''}`,
  data: {
    video: {
      id: video._id,
      title: video.title,
      isFreePreview: video.isFreePreview, // NEW FIELD
      // ... other fields
    }
  }
